### Instructions on how to interact with the work
In this game I designed, the player can press many keys on the keyboard to interact with the game:
- Up arrow keys: Move the whole field up the Z-axis
- Down arrow keys: Move the whole scene down
- Left arrow key: Moves the entire scene to the left
- Right arrow key: Moves the entire scene to the right
- "r" key: Rotate the entire scene 90 degrees clockwise along the Z axis
- "s" key: Random small cubes create a smooth bouncing animation in the Z-axis direction, while stationary large cubes remain stationary.
- "w" key: Stationary large cubes produce a smooth bouncing animation in the Z-axis direction, while random small cubes remain stationary.
- "a" key: All cubes will produce a smooth bouncing animation
- "d" key: Randomly change the color of the cube
