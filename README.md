## Instructions on how to interact with the work
In this work I designed, the player can press many keys on the keyboard to interact with the work:
- Up arrow keys: Move the whole field up the Z-axis
- Down arrow keys: Move the whole scene down
- Left arrow key: Moves the entire scene to the left
- Right arrow key: Moves the entire scene to the right
- "r" key: Rotate the entire scene 90 degrees clockwise along the Z axis
- "s" key: Random small cubes create a smooth bouncing animation in the Z-axis direction, while stationary large cubes remain stationary.
- "w" key: Stationary large cubes produce a smooth bouncing animation in the Z-axis direction, while random small cubes remain stationary.
- "a" key: All cubes will produce a smooth bouncing animation
- "d" key: Randomly change the color of the cube
  
## Details of your individual approach
### The method I choose
- User Input: Incorporate mouse or keyboard inputs for animation.

### The properties that have been animated
1. **Motion animation of Plate position:**
  - The position of the plane object can be translated based on key input. In this animation, when users press the up, down, left and right arrow keys, the plane moves along a certain axis.
2. **Bounce animation of Random Boxes:**
  - When the W, A and S keys are pressed separately, the blocks will have different animation effects in the vertical direction, they will move up and down the Z axis, and they will smoothly bounce up and down through the lerp() function.
3. **Rotating animation of the scene:**
  - The entire scene rotates 90 degrees when the user presses the R key. The rotation is done by rotateScene method, and I use lerp() function to make the rotation process smooth, rather than abruptly jump to a new direction.
4. **Color change animation:**
  - Through the toggleColorChange function, the color of the plane and the square changes randomly.

### References of inspiration for code

1. **About the way it moves**
- ![An image of a lemon](https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/3880666/screenshots/6867072/lemon-animation-800x600.gif)
  - It's "Animated lemon driving on a skateboard." I took inspiration from the way the lemons slide, adding a slow motion to the overall movement.

2. **About the way it bounce up and down**
- ![An image of a ball](https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/4082794/screenshots/14140510/media/a41f4081199205aca2916e15baa86253.gif)
  - This is a gif about loading. I got inspiration from this gif and changed the normal sliding up and down into a simple bouncing animation effect.

#### technical explanation
1. **Plate position motion animation:**
- In the code I modified, the position of the plate can be adjusted by the arrow keys, and each time the arrow keys are pressed, the plate moves a certain distance in the specified direction. The moveScene method is used to process these keyboard inputs and update the target offset values (targetXOffset and targetYOffset). Also, in the draw method I used the lerp() function to ensure smooth translation transitions. Here is the code:
```
updateBounceOffsets() {
    if (this.bounceSettings.allX) {
        this.bounceOffsets.x = sin(frameCount * 0.1) * 20;
    }
    if (this.bounceSettings.allY) {
        this.bounceOffsets.y = sin(frameCount * 0.1) * 20;
    }
    if (this.bounceSettings.platesZ || this.bounceSettings.randomBoxesZ) {
        this.bounceOffsets.z = sin(frameCount * 0.1) * 20;
    }
}
```

2. **Bounce animation of Random Boxes:**
- Bounces of boxes are animated by the bounceSettings and updateBounceOffsets methods.  When the 'S', 'W', or 'A' keys are pressed, different bounceSettings Settings trigger a bounce-animation of the random box on the z-axis.  The specific offset is generated by sin function. Here is the code:
```
  updateBounceOffsets() {
    if (this.bounceSettings.allX) {
        this.bounceOffsets.x = sin(frameCount * 0.1) * 20;
    }
    if (this.bounceSettings.allY) {
        this.bounceOffsets.y = sin(frameCount * 0.1) * 20;
    }
    if (this.bounceSettings.platesZ || this.bounceSettings.randomBoxesZ) {
        this.bounceOffsets.z = sin(frameCount * 0.1) * 20;
    }
}
```

3. **Rotating animation of the scene:**
- By pressing the 'R' key, the scene can be rotated 90 degrees centered on the z-axis. This function is implemented by the rotateScene method, which specifies the rotation target Angle by changing the targetRotation value. At the same time, I use the lerp function to gradually transition between the currentRotation and targetRotation to ensure smooth rotation. Here is the code:
```
 rotateScene(direction) {
    if (direction === 'left') {
        this.targetRotation -= PI / 2;
    } else if (direction === 'right') {
        this.targetRotation += PI / 2;
    }
}
```

4. **Color change animation:**
- By calling the toggleColorChange function, the colors of the plates and random boxes in the scene change randomly. After pressing the 'D' key, the toggleColorChange method assigns a new random color to each plate and box. Here is the code:
```
 toggleColorChange() {
    this.plates.forEach(plate => plate.color = random([this.colors.red, this.colors.blue, this.colors.grey, this.colors.yellow]));
    this.randomBoxes.forEach(box => box.color = random([this.colors.red, this.colors.blue, this.colors.grey, this.colors.yellow]));
}
```
